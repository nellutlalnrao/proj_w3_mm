# ChainGuardian â€“ Modular Security Snaps for MetaMask

# Overview
# ChainGuardian is an experimental security framework built with MetaMask Flask and Snaps. It allows users and developers to analyze and assess blockchain transactions before signing, using plugin-like modules called Snaps. These Snaps can scan for threats, simulate contracts, or validate cross-chain interactions in real-time.
