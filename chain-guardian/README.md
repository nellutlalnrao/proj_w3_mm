# ChainGuardian â€“ Modular Security Snaps for MetaMask

## Overview
ChainGuardian is an experimental security framework built with **MetaMask Flask** and **Snaps**. It allows users and developers to intercept, analyze and assess any blockchain transactions that a user is about to sign via MetaMask (particularly **EVM-compatible blockchain transactions** - before the wallet processes the signature), using plugin-like modules called **Snaps**. These Snaps can scan for threats, simulate contracts, or validate cross-chain interactions in real-time.  

ChainGuardian acts like a **security middleware** between MetaMask and the blockchain, powered by Snaps, which are plugin-like scripts running in a secure sandboxed environment inside MetaMask Flask.
It allows:
-   **Custom threat detection** on transactions.
-   **Contract simulation** before sending funds.
-   **Cross-chain validation** (e.g., warning users when interacting with unverified bridges).
-   **Plugin-based modularity**, so anyone can write their own security Snap.

## Developer Use-Case
When MetaMask Snap Store goes live, ChainGuardian can:
-   Be installed by users from a trusted registry.
-   Act as a **Modular Security Engine** like an antivirus for wallets.
-   Be extended by the community through open Snap plugins.

If you're building a dApp, you can integrate ChainGuardian to:
-   Scan all user-signed actions through Snap plugins
-   Show detailed diagnostics on risky contract behavior
-   Extend with custom plugins for compliance, token verification, etc.

## Limitations
-   **MetaMask Flask only:** Not compatible with the standard MetaMask browser extension.
-   **Snap permissions sandbox:** Limited APIs and no access to full blockchain state.
-   **No production deployment path yet:** Must wait for Snap Store.
-   **UX challenges:** Requires users to interpret security prompts correctly.
